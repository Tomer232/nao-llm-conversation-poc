{"speaker": "user", "text": "I will answer questions after the lecture. At its core, global warming refers to the long-term rise in Earth's average surface temperature due to the human activities, primarily the emissions of greenhouse gases. It is not just about hotter summers. It's a symptom of global warming.", "ts": 1765280835.1348538}
